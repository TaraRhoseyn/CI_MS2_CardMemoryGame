## Project Goals

### Website owner business goals

- I want users to be able to play an enjoyable and intuitive game. 
- I want users to return to the website to continue playing the game.

### User goals

- Learn the rules of a game before I play. 
- Play a game that is enjoyable and challenging. 
- Play a game that encourages me to return to the game beyond the first play through. 
- Play a game that gives me clear feedback on my performance. 
- Play a game that has clear objectives to winning.
