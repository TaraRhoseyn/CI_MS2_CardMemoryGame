## Project Goals

### Website owner business goals

- I want users to be able to play an enjoyable and intuitive game. 
- I want users to return to the website to continue playing the game. 
- I want users to be able to give feedback on the game easily so that future versions are optimised for the best user experience based on user needs.

### User goals

- Learn the rules of a game before I play. 
- Play a game that is enjoyable and challenging. 
- Play a game that encourages me to return to the game beyond the first play through. 
- Play a game that gives me clear feedback on my performance. 
- Play a game that has clear objectives to winning. 

## User experience

I have designed the game with mobile in mind by building the responsive layout mobile-first using Bootstrap.

The user experience is structured around three main goals: (a) to allow users to learn the game, (b) select the difficulty at which they'd like to play and (c) encourage users to return and play through again. The main call to actions on the website are related to replayability and encouraging users to make choices that impact their own experience of the game, for example, the game will not start until a user has decided on the difficulty level. 

### User stories

I have divided my user stories into two categories: first-time users and regular visitors, with the understanding that one of the key goals of the website is to encourage replayability of the game.

#### First-time users

1. As a first-time user, I want to understand the objective and rules of the game upfront and clearly. 
2. As a first-time user, I want to use the game to challenge my memory. 
3. As a first-time user, I want to be able to navigate the website quickly and with clear direction and prompts. 
4. As a first-time user, I want to be able to play the game across all personal devices. 
5. As a first-time user, I want to keep track of my score to monitor my performance in the game. 
6. As a first-time user, I want to see how long it takes me to complete the game. 
7. As a first-time user, I want the ability to select what level difficulty I want to play at.

#### Regular visitor

8. As a regular visitor, I want to be able to give feedback to improve the game over time. 
9. As a regular visitor, I want to see my score and move counter so that I can challenge myself the next time I play to beat it. 
10. As a regular visitor, I want to see how long it takes me to complete the game so I can challenge myself the next time I play to beat it. 
11. As a regular visitor, I want to be able to play a variety of difficulty levels so that the game remains fresh and interesting.

#### Site owner

12. As a site owner, I want to be able to collect feedback from users in a simple and easy way. 
13. As a site owner, I want users to be able to navigate the website easily so that users are more likely to have an enjoyable experience and return to the game.

### Scope

The scope of the project in itâ€™s first release is defined by the following features:

- Instructions that clearly explain the objective and mechanics of the game. 
- A home page to select which game difficulty to play at before the game is generated. 
- A generate game board with varying numbers of cards depending on game difficulty selected. 
- Navigation button, such as 'Return home' once the game is generated to re-select game difficulty or revisit instructions. 
- A reset button to reset the game. 
- A score tracker that goes up with each correct match. 
- A moves counter that goes up with each pair guessed. 
- A timer to keep track of how long it takes a player to complete the game. 
- An error page (404.html) that directs site users back to the home page (index.html) in the event of a broken URL.
- Favicon icon to help users identify the site.
- A contact page for the site owner to collect feedback about the game to feed back into future versions. 

Features to be built into future releases: 

- A scoreboard with players scores to allow users to compete with their own high score and that of others online. 
- The ability to toggle between different 'skins' or 'themes' depending on how high a score you gain in your play through of the 'fruits' theme. 
- Card flipping animation when a card is selected. 
- Audio and visual animation when a matching pair is found. 
- Audio and visual animation within the browswer when the game is completed.

### Design 

My overall approach to the design came from a desire to create a gane that was fun, engaging and simple to understand. From a UX perspective, I also wanted a game where the objective and control over the experience of the game did not cause cognitive overload.

#### Colour Scheme

I chose to use pink and greens as the primary scheme to bring to the user's mind connotations of nature and positivity. I chose a complementary colour scheme (pink/green) to be able to draw particular attention to key call to actions.

#### Typography

My heading font is Rokkit from Google Fonts. I chose this font because I wanted a font that would stand out for it's robust and sharp form against the softness and vibrance of the fruit motifs. 

My body font is Mina from Google Fonts. I chose this font because it had an aesthetically pleasing similarity to Rokkit, but with enough difference (particularly in font weight) to differentiate between heading and body text.

#### Imagery

I chose not to use photography on the website and adopted a cartoonish style instead. I did this to keep a consistent style across the website and promote a tone that was fun and engaging, particularly for children. 

I created all of the cards and images of fruits in Canva Premium. 

## Features

### Current Features

#### Feature 1: Home page

The home page contains four main sections: 

1. A header displaying the name of the game and what type of game it is.
2. Instructions on how to play the game and it's objective.
3. Three difficulty levels (easy, moderate, and hard) to select to trigger the game being loaded.
4. A footer with social media links (placeholder links for now).

The page is fully responsive on mobile and tablet. The copy found in Section 2, like all copy on the website, was written by myself.

**Section 1: Header**

This header is the same used throughout the website and communicates to users the name of the game and what type of game it is. Unlike typical headers used in websites such as e-commerce sites, portfolio sites and lead generation sites, no inbound links are found in this header. I did not include links in the header as I wanted the user to be able to navigate the website based on what place they were in the game. While the header is the same colour as the website background, a bottom border is visible to differentiate it from the rest of the page.

![Header](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS2_CardMemoryGame/blob/main/docs/features/feature-one-s1.PNG)

**Section 2: The instructions**

These instructions tell the user clearly the objectives of the game and the rules of play. These are visible before the game is loaded so that users have the chance to familiarise themselves with the rules before jumping into gameplay. 

![Rules](https://github.com/TaraRhoseyn/CI_MS2_CardMemoryGame/blob/main/docs/features/feature-one-s2.PNG)

**Section 3: Difficulty selection**

I had originally planned for the home page to automatically load in Easy mode, then the player would have a choice via a drop down menu what level they wish to play at. There would also have been a button which would have loaded a modal with instructions on. However, I decided against this route and made the user decide which level before the game loaded because of the following reasons: 

- I felt it more sensible to let users familiarise themselves with the rules of play **before** the game loaded. 
- It was easier to code decision-branching and logic statements when the elements used by event listeners were more seperated. 
- During development, it was easier to isolate one single mode of play and build the game from there. I first build the moderate version of the game. Once that version was working well and bug-free, I then built the easy and hard versions.

#### Feature 4: Hard mode of the game

Upon pressing 'Hard' in the homepage, the moderate mode of the game with 18 card tiles is generated for the user. The first version of the hard mode was 24 cards so that each level of difficulty doubled (easy = 6, moderate = 12, hard = 24). Upon testing this it quickly became clear 24 was too challenging, particularly on small device screens. To keep the game simple and playable on mobile, hard was changed to 18, 6 more than moderate.

#### Feature 6: The timer

On all difficulty levels of the game a regular timer is visible in the top right-hand corner of the game. This allows returning users to challenge themselves by trying to beat their previous scores. This gives them an incentive to return to the game after the first play-through. It also encourages users to try the different levels to see how long they take them to complete.
